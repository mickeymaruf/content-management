                ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, This is Maruf. A young and driven undergrad student from Bangladesh with a passion for solving problems and scaling software solutions.

                I describe myself as a Tech Enthusiast, Self-taught Developer who is always curious to learn new tools and technology that make life easier.
                <br /><br />
                Why Tech?
                Well, I'm interested in a career in technology because I want to use my skills and knowledge to make other people's jobs easier and more productive.
                That's why I've dedicated myself to growing within the field of development with my passion.
                <br /><br />
                I am a quick learner, self-motivated, self-taught, responsible, disciplined, and deadline-oriented person who can fit in any environment. Besides that, I never hesitate to make connections with others and learn from them. So, feel free to connect with me.

                And obviously thanks for reading this so far.
